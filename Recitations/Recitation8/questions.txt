1. Refer q1.c file. Compile the file using "gcc -g -Og" options.
   Submit the exact assembly instructions that will be executed inside the sparse_switch_eq() function for the given values of x,y,z.
   Do not simply submit the raw assembly code of the whole function. Many of the lines will not be executed because of conditional jumps.
   You can use gdb for this question.

2. Submit the exact list of commands you used after switching on gdb, which helped you get the answer for q1.


3. When code q3.c is run, it leads to a "segmentation fault". Use gdb to find out the line number at which segmentation fault occured.

4. What is the reason for this fault in q3.c?
