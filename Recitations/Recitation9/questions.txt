1. What will be the values of all four condition flags after addb operation on two integers:
a) 11111111, 00000010
b) 01110001, 00101011

Note: the numbers are written in binary representation, and addb is an operation on two 8-bit integers.



2. 
A function with prototype: void foo(long x, long* y);
is compiled into assembly code, yielding the following:

foo:
	cmpq	$234, %rdi
	jle	.L2
	cmpq	$578, (%rsi)
	jg	.L2
	movq	$701, (%rsi)
.L2:
	ret

Write C code for foo that will have an effect equivalent to the assembly code shown. Be extra cautious about paranthesis in movq and cmpq.



3. What are the "maximum" number of stack frames of fibonacci() that will simultaneously exist at some point during the execution of fibonacci(6).
The code for fibonacci() is as follows:

long fibonacci(long n) {
    if(n<=2)
        return 1;
    else
        return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2);
}

4. What are the "total" number of stack frames of fibonacci() that will eventually be created during the execution of fibonacci(6).
Use same code as q3
