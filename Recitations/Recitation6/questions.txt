1. The file q1.c has a memory leak problem. The total memory utilized by the program keeps on increasing as the number of iterations increase. Modify the function foo() to avoid this.

2. 2D array (or matrix) addition in dynamic memory: Write a C program to do the following and submit it as q2.c
   Create two int matrices A and B of size 1000x3000 in heap memory using malloc.
   Define A(i,j) = i + j
   Define B(i,j) = i * j
   0 <= i <= 1000.  0 <= j <= 3000.
   Create another matrix C of same dimensions in heap memory. Do the matrix addition such that C(i,j) = A(i,j) + B(i,j)

   Note: heap memory only supports 1D data structures. So you will have to store the entire matrix in linear fashion.

3. The code q3.c leads to a "segmentation fault" when executing. Fix the bug and submit the code. Include a comment at the top explaining the reason for code failure.

4. The code q4.c contains the same program but array is declared statically instead of using malloc. This leads to a segmentation fault sonner than q3.c. Fix the bug and submit the code. Include a comment at the top explaining the reason for code failure, and why did the error occur before q3.c.
